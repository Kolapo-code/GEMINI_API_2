        "To showcase how we build a RAG, we will first build one for the Text case, and generalize it further after. Here is the general idea:\n",
        "1. **Data Preparation** (done above): We first collected various types of data from NASA's public archive related to the Apollo 11 mission, including text, video, and audio files.\n",
        "2. **Data Extraction and Summarization**: Extract the multimodal data from images, e.g. extract text from images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and use Gemini to generate summaries using a specialized prompt.\n",
        "3. **Embedding Generation**: Convert the generated summaries into vector embeddings using Gemini's Text Embedding Model. These embeddings represent the summaries in a numerical format suitable for efficient similarity searches.\n",
        "4. **Creating a Vector Database**: A Vector database was created to store the embeddings. This database facilitates fast and efficient retrieval of relevant documents based on similarity searches. We chose to use Chroma DB.\n",
        "5. **Querying the RAG System**: For a given query, the system retrieves the most relevant documents (based on their embeddings) and generates a response using the retrieved documents as context.\n",
        "\n",
        "Something important to note is that RAGs are usually used only when there is a surplus of data. In other words, if the data can't fit into the model prompt. In this case, the data we provided likely can fit into Gemini's 1 million token window, but for the sake of simplicity and restrictions of Google Colab's runtime, we opted to use a smaller set of data."

            "The Apollo 11 mission was a monumental achievement in human history, marking the first time humans landed on the moon. Here's a summary of the key events:\n",
            "\n",
            "**Launch and Journey to the Moon:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Launch:** The Apollo 11 mission launched on July 16, 1969, carrying astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins.\n",
            "* **Earth Orbit Insertion:** The Saturn V rocket successfully launched the spacecraft into Earth orbit, marking the initial stage of the mission.\n",
            "* **Translunar Coast (TLC):** The spacecraft then transitioned into a trajectory towards the moon, a crucial phase where the crew performed several tasks:\n",
            "    * **Transposition, Docking, and LM Ejection:** The Command and Service Module (CSM) separated from the Saturn V's third stage and docked with the Lunar Module (LM), which was then ejected for a separate descent to the moon.\n",
            "    * **Separation from the SIVB:** The spacecraft separated from the third stage of the Saturn V rocket, also known as SIVB, using a series of maneuvers.\n",
            "    * **Evasive Maneuver:** The crew performed an evasive maneuver to ensure the spacecraft was not on a collision course with the SIVB.\n",
            "    * **SIVB Propulsive Venting:** The SIVB underwent a venting procedure to ensure its fuel and oxidizer were consumed.\n",
            "    * **Navigation Sightings:** The crew performed navigation sightings to ensure they were on the correct trajectory towards the moon.\n",
            "    * **Midcourse Corrections:**  The crew executed midcourse corrections to fine-tune the spacecraft's trajectory. \n",
            "* **Lunar Orbit Insertion (LOI):** The spacecraft entered lunar orbit, marking the final stage before the lunar landing.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Lunar Landing and Exploration:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Lunar Module Landing:** On July 20, 1969, Armstrong and Aldrin descended in the Lunar Module (LM) to the surface of the moon while Collins remained in lunar orbit.\n",
            "* **First Steps on the Moon:** Armstrong became the first person to set foot on the moon, famously uttering the words \"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\" Aldrin soon joined him.\n",
            "* **Lunar Surface Exploration:** Armstrong and Aldrin spent over two hours outside the LM, collecting lunar samples, taking photographs, and planting the American flag.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Return to Earth:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Lunar Ascent:** Armstrong and Aldrin launched back from the lunar surface in the LM, leaving behind the descent stage on the moon.\n",
            "* **Docking and Trans-Earth Coast:** The LM docked with the CSM, and the astronauts transferred back into the command module, leaving the LM behind. The spacecraft then embarked on its journey back to Earth.\n",
            "* **Splashdown:** The Apollo 11 capsule splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24, 1969, marking the successful conclusion of the mission.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Apollo 11 mission was a resounding success, forever altering our understanding of the universe and inspiring generations to come. The mission's detailed plan, executed with precision, showcased the dedication and ingenuity of those involved.\n",
